    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",

    "### Implementation: Data Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",
    "\n",
    "|   | someFeature |                    | someFeature_A | someFeature_B | someFeature_C |\n",
    "| :-: | :-: |                            | :-: | :-: | :-: |\n",
    "| 0 |  B  |  | 0 | 1 | 0 |\n",
    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",
    " - Convert the target label `'income_raw'` to numerical entries.\n",
    "   - Set records with \"<=50K\" to `0` and records with \">50K\" to `1`."

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most 50k, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say **\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"** and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "**Accuracy** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Precision** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "### Question 1 - Naive Predictor Performace\n",
    "* If we chose a model that always predicted an individual made more than $50,000, what would  that model's accuracy and F-score be on this dataset? You must use the code cell below and assign your results to `'accuracy'` and `'fscore'` to be used later.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Please note** that the purpose of generating a naive predictor is simply to show what a base model without any intelligence would look like. In the real world, ideally your base model would be either the results of a previous model or could be based on a research paper upon which you are looking to improve. When there is no benchmark model set, getting a result better than random choice is a place you could start from.\n",

    "\n",
    "* When we have a model that always predicts '1' (i.e. the individual makes more than 50k) then our model will have no True Negatives(TN) or False Negatives(FN) as we are not making any negative('0' value) predictions. Therefore our Accuracy in this case becomes the same as our Precision(True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)) as every prediction that we have made with value '1' that should have '0' becomes a False Positive; therefore our denominator in this case is the total number of records we have in total. \n",
    "* Our Recall score(True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)) in this setting becomes 1 as we have no False Negatives."

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Decision Trees\n",
    "  >- The decision tree algorithm can be adopted in various business situations. For example, a bank may have thousands of customers per week who applied for loan, and evaluating their trustworthiness can be onerous for human employees at bank since the repaying ability of debtors can have a huge influence on a bank's profibility and even liquidity. This is where classification models like decision trees comes into play, it helps to decide whether a debt applier is trustworthy based on different features that are used for prediction, saving a great deal of time and manpower.\n",
    "  >- Decision trees is a dual-use algorithm because it can be used either for classification — to determine the category for an observation — or for estimation of numeric value, however, decision Trees work best when they are trained to assign a data point to a class--preferably one of only a few possible classes.\n",
    "  >- Decision trees can be extremely sensitive to small perturbations in the data: a slight change can result in a drastically different tree. They can easily overfit. This can be negated by validation methods and pruning, but this is a grey area. \n",
    "  >- We need to predict whether an individual earn more than \\$50,000 per year, thus a classification model is needed, and decision trees algorithm is a typical model of that type.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Support Vector Machine\n",
    "  >- Support vector machines are used in many tasks when it comes to dealing with images. SVMs are particularly used in one definite application of image processing: facial features extraction and recognition. Also, We can use support vector machines to classify the handwriting of two different people. SVMs train better when it comes to applications such as detection of the curves and straights used in typical handwriting. [[REF]](https://iq.opengenus.org/applications-of-svm/#:~:text=Text-based%20applications%20We%20can%20use%20support%20vector%20machines,can%20also%20be%20used%20in%20pure%20computer-based%20texts.)\n",
    "  >- Support vector machines are effective in high dimensional spaces, and they are versatile: different Kernel functions can be specified for the decision function. Common kernels are provided, but it is also possible to specify custom kernels.\n",
    "  >- If the number of features is much greater than the number of samples, avoid over-fitting in choosing Kernel functions and regularization term is crucial. SVMs do not directly provide probability estimates, these are calculated using an expensive five-fold cross-validation. [[REF]](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/svm.html#:~:text=The%20advantages%20of%20support%20vector%20machines%20are%3A%201,it%20is%20also%20possible%20to%20specify%20custom%20kernels.)\n",
    "  >- We need to predict whether an individual earn more than \\$50,000 per year, thus a classification model is needed, and SVMs algorithm is a strong and reliable model of that type.\n",
    "  \n",
    "3) Logistic Regression\n",
    "  >- Logistic regression is used exclusively for binary classification senarios, for example, to determine whether a suspect is culpable or not. \n",
    "  >- Logistic regression is easier to implement, interpret, and very efficient to train. It makes no assumptions about distributions of classes in feature space. It not only provides a measure of how appropriate a predictor(coefficient size)is, but also its direction of association (positive or negative).\n",
    "  >- If the number of observations is lesser than the number of features, Logistic Regression should not be used, otherwise, it may lead to overfitting. The major limitation of Logistic Regression is the assumption of linearity between the dependent variable and the independent variables. It can only be used to predict discrete functions. Hence, the dependent variable of Logistic Regression is bound to the discrete number set. Non-linear problems can’t be solved with logistic regression because it has a linear decision surface. Linearly separable data is rarely found in real-world scenarios. [[REF]](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-logistic-regression/)\n",
    "  >- The problem is a binomial problem that can be solved with bianry classification algorithm just like logistic regression."

    "Logistic regression is a classification algorithm. It is used to predict a binary outcome based on a set of independent variables. A binary outcome is one where there are only two possible scenarios—either the event happens (1) or it does not happen (0). Independent variables are those variables or factors which may influence the outcome (or dependent variable). So: ogistic regression is the correct type of analysis to use when you’re working with binary data. You know you’re dealing with binary data when the output or dependent variable is dichotomous or categorical in nature; in other words, if it fits into one of two categories (such as “yes” or “no”, “pass” or “fail”, and so on).

    "In our case, predicting if an individual earns more than 50 thousand dollars per year or not is perfectly a binary classification senario, which logistic regression can be fit effectively to the data."

    "- Create a dictionary of parameters you wish to tune for the chosen model.\n",
    " - Example: `parameters = {'parameter' : [list of values]}`.\n",
    " - **Note:** Avoid tuning the `max_features` parameter of your learner if that parameter is available!\n",

Of course, features like work_class, education_level and occupation can provide additional information about the social status or intelligence of that person, which can reflect indirectly his or her income level.

    "* Maybe capital_loss can more decisively indicate whether an individual earns less than \\$50,000 annually, because if there is capital loss then the likelihood of earning a large amount of money can be scant. As to hours_per_week, it demonstrates how much an individual works weekly, thus this feature can have a say in income level."

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
